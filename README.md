# Floyd-Warshall

This program was made to test Floyd's and Warshall's algorithm between a 3 pitchers puzzle.

A pitchers puzzle move is a single pitcher pour (full-pour or under-pour) starting from one pitchers configuration and that
pour results in a different pitchers configuration. Note that you cannot pour an arbitrary amount of the
liquid from one pitcher into another: it must be a full-pour which empties the source pitcher into the
target pitcher (with no spilling), or an under-pour which exactly fills (tops off) the target pitcher.

The first Pitcher is 16 liters
The second Pitcher is 9 liters
The third Pitcher is 7 liters

Initial config: (16,0,0)
